# Rakcha-Hub


A dynamic, full-stack personal workspace designed for focus, productivity, and creativity. Built with Node.js, Express, and Vanilla JavaScript.


## About The Project

Rakcha Hub started as a simple to-do list and evolved into a comprehensive, interactive workspace. It moves beyond linear checklists, offering a visual, zoomable canvas where you can organize tasks, ideas, and notes as draggable "nodes."

This application is built to be a private sanctuary for deep work, combining task management with integrated tools to help maintain focus and spark creativity, like a Pomodoro timer, a music player, and a free-form digital whiteboard.

## üí° Future Ideas

This project has a solid foundation that can be extended with more powerful features:

*   **Migrate to a Persistent Database:** Replace the in-memory storage with a real database like MongoDB Atlas to make all data permanent.
*   **Full User Authentication:** Implement a proper authentication system with hashed passwords and user accounts.
*   **Node Connections:** Add the ability to draw visual connections between nodes to create a true mind-map or "Zettelkasten."
*   **Cloud Storage for Whiteboard:** Save and load whiteboard sessions.
